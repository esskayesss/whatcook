# whatcook

Made for an internship assignment. It fulfils the following deliverables: 
- [x] Adding ingredients from a drop down
- [x] Detecting ingredients from a captured image
- [x] Specifying dietary preferences
- [x] In-Memory pre-defined recipe database with _54 entries_. Contains nutritional information, random ratings, etc.
- [x] Ranked recipe suggestions
- [x] Saving favorite recipes in localStorage
- [ ] Rating recipes
- [ ] Recipe suggestions (with a dummy recommendation engine that spews random recipes with a few saved ones)

Additional points that haven't directly been addressed:
  - `protein content`, etc has been ignored; this has more to do with populating the database than coding.
  - `serving size` has been ignored; again, this has more to do with the database, storing multiple versions per recipe.
  - `difficulty` and `cooking time` have been ignored; such filtering has already been showcased with the dietary preferences, has more to do with extending database entries.
